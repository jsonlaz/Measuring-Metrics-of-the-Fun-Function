# Measuring Metrics of the Fun Function in MATLAB

<h2>Description</h2>
To measure the performance of the fun function, the code uses the tic and toc functions to measure the execution time of the function. The tic function starts a timer, and the toc function 
stops the timer and returns the elapsed time in seconds. The code also uses the whos function to measure the memory usage of the input and output vectors and the disp function to print the 
number of iterations of the for loop.

## Reesult

Create a figure with two subplots.

## Conclusion

The code demonstrates how to define a MATLAB function, apply it to a random input vector, and visualize the input and output vectors using subplots. It also shows how to 
measure the performance of the function in terms of execution time, memory usage, and number of iterations, and how to save and publish the results as a PDF file
